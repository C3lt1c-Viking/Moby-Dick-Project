# Moby Dick Project

## A simple project designed as a test model for Source Allies

### About This Project;
The Moby Dick Project showcases my abilites to write code in order to accomplish a task. The task at hand is the ability to
create a list of 100 most frequently used words in the novel. And after that is accomplished, then I will ensure that the list does
not include any of the provided "stop" words.

### Project Code Structure;
For the front-end of the website, I will be utilizing HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap Libraries alongside with Font-Awesome.  
For the back-end of the website, I will be utilizing PHP.
