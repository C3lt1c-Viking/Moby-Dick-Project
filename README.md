### About This Project;
The concept of this project is to prove that I have the ability to write code. But not just to write code, be able to be efficient in my coding, as well
as document proper notes throughout the project so that if need to, another programmer may step in and see what does what.

### Project Goals;
This project is a rather simple one, however, I have taken extra steps in my work. The project is to take text from a text file, and discover the top 100 words, and then utilize another
text file in order to include stop-words to be removed from the top 100 most used words. What I ended up doing, was providing 3 examples, and then I followed those examples by showcasing
the results for the main project. The Examples & Projects are in section 1-3.  
1) This is the generic form that will display all words and how many times that word is used in the reference.  
2) This will generate the top 100 used words (top 3 for examples).  
3) This will display the top 100 used words (top 3 for examples) and use stop words to remove certain words from being displayed in the top 100 used words.

### How is this Project Setup;
As you can see now, this entire project is setup in a unique way. Instead of have everything all on 1 page, I have broken each section onto their own pages. The reason
for this action is to easily identify and fix/update any section of the project without having to read through hundreds of lines of code. So instead of scrolling down to line 77, you can see
that that section belongs to Project 2, and you can just pull up project 2 and be able to make the alterations you need. I find that doing this helps reduce main page code, and is a more
efficient way to handle any type of project.

### Libraries & Resources;
When we look at this project, we can see I have integrated Bootstrap V3.3.7, this will be the base foundation for customizing the website to appear slightly better
than that of the early 90's basic web page. While still remaining fairly basic, I am bringing new technologies to this once basic website.  

I have also integrated Font-Awesome. I will be utilizing this in order to add some icons in the website. This is ideal to replace images and will not load down your
website with a lot of images, you can use Font-Awesome in order to bring a light-weight icons into your website.  

Included in this project, I have included customized fonts by Google. By including some fonts into this website, I have the ability to take regular text for headings & paragraphs and
add some style to them. I have only selected 4 different fonts from Google, but for this project, that is all that I need.   

Customized CSS is also in play here as it allows me to give more details to each specific element. Or create a group of elements that will allow me to use 1 style over and over again. By using
a custom built CSS page, we have the ability to edit the style manually and be in more control of our website.

JavaScript will be introduced in this project soon as it will allow me to add a small section of code that will hide/show the output of the results in each section. By doing this, I can reduce the
main page screen size and be able to easily focus on each section. With buttons that will allow me to hide/show div elements inside of div elements, we will be able to hide or show each sections results, thus making the review much more friendly as they do not have to scroll all the way past hundreds of thousands of words/results to see the final result.  

GitHub is utilized in order to push my code to a repository in which allows other people to pull the code and review it on their local computers. This will also aid in the version control as well. By
utilizing GitHub and pushing when I have an update will allow me to discover what works and what does not. And in the unfortunate event in which I screw everything up completely, I can go back to
a former version of the project that worked perfectly, and pull from that time, and then continue working on the project.

### About the Coder;
Aubrey Love (AKA C3lt1c Viking) is your typical programming nerd. I enjoy watching Science Fiction movies such as Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and other titles. I do enjoy playing games such as Call of Duty, DnD, Star Wars, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc. and I stream almost every day on Twitch, Facebook, & YouTube. Outside of being a nerd, my work-related hobbies includes writing code in order to achieve a project
goal. When I am not being a complete nerd, or writing code, one can find me studying for my sermons as I recently have taken a volunteer role as a pastor at a local church. And in free time, I do enjoy spending time with my wife and kids. I have been married for over 14-Years, and we have 4 amazing kids together. We enjoy doing things together like going to the park, walking through zoo's, and a variety of other things.   
I do enjoy writing code, and making new things possible with programming. My main languages of writing code are;  
* Ruby on Rails  
* PHP  
* C++
While I have the ability to build video games, create android apps, and computer based applications, I prefer web-based content as it is my preferred method.
